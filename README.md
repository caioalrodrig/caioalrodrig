### Hi there ✋

Almost a graduated electronic engineer, for Universidade Federal de Juiz de Fora, with conclusion planned for 2024. My main interests are on digital signal processing and power electronic dinamic control. These days I've been mostly developing solutions at Equipe Capivara as co-worker at LABSOLAR veehicles team.
