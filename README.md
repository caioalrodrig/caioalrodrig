### Hi there âœ‹

Almost a graduated electronic engineer, for Universidade Federal de Juiz de Fora, with conclusion planned for 2024. My main interests are on digital signal processing and power electronic dinamic control. At the present moment, I've been mostly developing microprocessed drivers for DC/BLDC motors as co-worker at LABSOLAR veehicles team.
